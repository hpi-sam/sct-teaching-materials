# Teaching Materials for Tool-Supported Statechart Modeling

Collection of teaching materials related to the example environments that are published with our validation framework: https://github.com/hpi-sam/sct-validation-framework



## Contents of this Repo

* Teaching Materials for the **[Warehouse with Autonomous Robots Environment](infinitewarehouse)**. Contains a separate assignment document and detailed specification document.
* Teaching Materials for the **[Vehicles and Traffic Lights Environment](infinitewarehouse)**. Contains an assignment document that contains two main statechart modeling tasks and a few minor tasks.
* A **[Tutorial for our Tool Support](tool_tutorial)**. Includes hints on the statechart syntax, a guide for installing and using the [YAKINDU Statechart Tools](https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/) and complete setup instructions and feature documentation for our [Validation Framework](https://github.com/hpi-sam/sct-validation-framework) 
* A **[LaTeX Template](template)** for all aforementioned documents that can be modified.



## Language Note

**Note that as of now, all materials are available in German language only.**

However, anything that is actually captured in models or in the statecharts to be modeled, such as class or method names, is named in English, so that a translation is feasible without having to create alternative versions of the model and code artifacts.
